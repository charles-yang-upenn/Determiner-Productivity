the batch files in this directory creates the data reported in the paper.

runpinechimot.phase ==> Replication of Pine et al. 2013. Compares childrens' overlap by phase against the mother's full corpus.  (Table 3)

runpinechimot.all ==> Compares childrens' overlap in their full corpus against the mother's full corpus. (Table 4)

runpinemotmot.phase ==> Compares mother's overlap by phase--a la Pine et al.--against their own full corpus. (Table 6)

runpinemotmot.random ==> Compares mother's random 50% corpus against their own full corpus. (Table 6)

Due to the stochastic nature of the sampling scheme, every run will produce slightly different values but these do not affect the statistical significance of the results.
