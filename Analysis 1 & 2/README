run three "run" scripts to generate data for Fig 1, Table 1, and Table 2.

runcontrolfreq replicates Valian et al. (2009). It compares nouns' overlap values as a function of its frequency (Fig 1)

runoverlap replicates Yang (2013). It compares the expected overlap value against the empirical overlap value for all 12 children and their mothers. (Table 1)

runoverlap_phase compares the expected overlap value against the empirical overlap value for all 12 children in their phase one (a la Pine et al. 2013, see Analysis 3)
